# Vega-Visualizations
Some Vega Visualizations implemented in some projects and others example codes.
Almost all of these plots were created with Vega v2.
There is a Jupyter Notebook (Vega v2 vs Vega v3.ipynb) which is a (VERY) little comparison of Vega v2 and Vega v3 for an especific plot. This notebook will be actualized when will be possible and I'll be putting new plots in Vega v3.
